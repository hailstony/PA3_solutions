    associated with the given variable for the variables that have values assigned.

    For example, if the current variable is X and its neighbors are Y and Z (there are constraints (X,Y) and (X,Z)
    in csp.constraints), and the current assignment as Y=y, we want to check if the value x we want to assign to X
    violates the constraint c(x,y).  This method does not check c(x,Z), because Z is not yet assigned."""
